# Advanced Real-time AI Vision Application

## Overview

This application is a cutting-edge, real-time AI vision system that integrates multiple machine learning models to perform advanced computer vision tasks. It's designed to work directly in web browsers, leveraging the power of TensorFlow.js and other JavaScript-based AI libraries.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Object Detection**: Identifies and locates multiple objects in the video stream.
- **Pose Estimation**: Detects human poses and tracks key body points.
- **Face Detection and Analysis**: Recognizes faces and estimates age, gender, and expressions.
- **Behavior Analysis**: Interprets human actions like standing, walking, or running.
- **Statistical Anomaly Detection**: Identifies unusual patterns or behaviors.
- **QR Code Scanning**: Reads and decodes QR codes in real-time.
- **Text Extraction**: Performs Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on video frames.
- **Multi-model AI Integration**: Seamlessly combines multiple AI models for comprehensive analysis.
- **Responsive UI**: Provides camera controls and real-time visualization of AI outputs.

## Technologies Used

- TensorFlow.js
- COCO-SSD (for object detection)
- PoseNet (for pose estimation)
- Face-API.js (for face detection and analysis)
- OpenCV.js (for image processing)
- jsQR (for QR code scanning)
- Tesseract.js (for text extraction)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Open \`index.html\` in a modern web browser
3. Allow camera access when prompted
4. Use the on-screen controls to start the camera and initiate various detection features
